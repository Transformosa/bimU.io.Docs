# Collaborate in a Channel
A **Channel** on bimU.io Agile is a workspace where you and your team members can collaborate. It is a team environment that creates a secure boundary around your BIM models, issues, collaborators, etc. 

### Why "Channel"?
We call it **Channel** expressly for a number of reasons:
- It is a more generic term. Words like project, group, etc. can be quite specific in an organisation.
- It works with different levels of granularity, e.g. a package in a big project.
- It aligns with communication tools, e.g. Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc.

### View All Channels
To view all channels, you can either click the tiles icon button on the top menu bar or click the ``VIEW ALL CHANNELS`` button in the ``Pinned Channels`` panel on the dashboard.

### Create Channel
Click the ``CREATE CHANNEL`` button to create a new channel. If the ``Create channel with sample data`` option is ticked, sample issues and sample models will be added to the new channel created.

!!! warning "Note that you can't leave a channel if you're the only one channel admin."

### Archive Channel
When a project is finished, you might want to close out a channel while maintaining all the data. bimU.io Agile provides an archving option to make a channel completely hidden without losing any data. Go to the ``Settings`` page and scroll all the way down. You can do it from the ``Danger Zone``.

### Reactivate Channel
If you change your mind, it is fairly easy to make an archived channel visible again. Go to the ``All Channels`` page and click the ``VIEW ARCHIVED CHANNELS`` button. In the dialog, find an archived channel and click the ``Reactivate`` icon button.

### Delete Channel
We suggest you only delete a channel when necessary since all the data will be permanently erased on bimU.io Aigle's server, including issues, comments, models, etc. Go to the ``Settings`` page and scroll all the way down. You can do it from the ``Danger Zone``.
