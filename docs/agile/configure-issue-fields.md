# Configure Issue Fields
Issue field is basically metadata which provides additional information about an issue. It also allows project teams to captures data individually so that it’s easy to search and track later.

### Configurable Issue Fields
Below issue fields are configurable. You can add a new option, edit an existing option, or delete an option that is no longer required. For issue types, statuses, and priorities, every option can have a different color and icon for better readability.

#### Type
Issue types distinguish different types of tracked items to help you identify, categorise, and report on your team’s work. Default issue types are ``Clash``, ``Comment``, ``Non-Compliance``, ``Constructability``, ``RFI``.

#### Status
Issue statues define how an issue should be progressed in your workflow. The first status in the list is the initial status while the last status in the list is the final status. If an issue is in the final status, it is considered resolved and closed. Default issue statuses are ``To Do``, ``In Progress``, ``In Review``, ``Done``.

#### Priority
Issue priorities can be used to indicate if an issue has greater urgency than others. Default issue priorities are ``High``, ``Medium``, ``Low``.

#### Discipline
Disciplines are very project specific. You should define what disciplines should be involved in your design review workflow. Default disciplines are ``Architecture``, ``Structure``, ``MEP``, ``Façade``, ``Civil``.

#### Zone
Zones are particular areas in your project. For a building project, it can be a floor or a space. For an infrastructure project, it can be a package or a section. Default zones are ``GF``, ``1FL``, ``2FL``, ``RF``.
