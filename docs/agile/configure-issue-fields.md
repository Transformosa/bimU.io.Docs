# Configure Issue Fields

Some issues may have greater urgency than others, perhaps because they affect the most customers or because they represent a serious roadblock that needs to be solved for the project to continue smoothly.

Most ITS solutions also make it possible to assign issues to various persons in charge, monitor how they are being handled and how much time is being spent on them, ensure the compliance with internal workflows, perform statistical analysis, and automatically generate tickets based on customer inquiries, just to give a few examples.
