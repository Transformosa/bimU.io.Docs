### Create New Issue
**Issue** is normally a problem found in BIM models that you want to capture and track. Click the ``CREATE ISSUE`` button on the left menu to create a new issue. If you already have **bimU.io Launcher** installed and supported BIM software opened, it is possible to capture a snapshot of the active 3D view and its camera viewpoint. Fill in relevant issue information and then click ``Create``.

### Issues and Web Viewer
You can also create or view issues directly from bimU.io's web viewer. If a BIM model is opened in the web viewer, a snapshot of the current view as well as its camera viewpoint will automatically be captured when you create an issue. There's also an ``Issues`` panel on the right-hand side that allows you to view issues side by side and open viewpoints more quickly.
