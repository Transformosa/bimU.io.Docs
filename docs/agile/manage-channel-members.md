# Manage Channel Members
You are a channel admin by default when you create a new channel. Every team member added to the channel is a channel member. Managing channel mebmers properly allows you and your teams to work together more efficiently.

### View and Search Members
Go to the ``Members`` page, every channel member can view and search member details.

### Add Members to Channel
Only a channel admin can add members to a channel. Click the ``ADD MEMBER`` button on the ``Members`` page or look for the same option from plus icon button in the top menu bar. You can then send an invite to multiple email addresses.

### Join Channel
When your team members receive the invite, they can join your channel from the unique link in the email. If your team members haven't used bimU.io Agile before, they will be prompted to create a bimU.io Agile account in the first place.

### Member Roles and Permissions
There are two channel roles with different permissions: ``Admin`` and ``Member``. The default role for a new channel member is ``Member``. You need to be an ``Admin`` to change a member's role on the ``Members`` page.
