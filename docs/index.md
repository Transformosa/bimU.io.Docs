# bimU.io Viewer Overview

bimU.io Viewer is a full-fledged online BIM model viewer that truly works for every project member. BIM is not exclusive to BIM managers and technicians. We've built an easy-to-use platform for everyone to review 3D design data without getting hands dirty. Simply upload your BIM model and it will be accessible via a browser instantly. Do some markups then share it securely or embed it in your collaboration software. All can be done with the **Free** version of bimU.io Viewer.

### Fully Functional Design Review Tool

What's more than a 3D visulisation tool? bimU.io Viewer is natively built for reviewing engineering design in the Cloud. It includes everything you need to interrogate BIM data, such as versatile 3D navigation tools, a cloud-hosted BIM database, an interoperable markup view, etc. bimU.io transforms your BIM model to a lightweight BIM format that is blazingly fast and smooth over the internet and available on all your devices. What you really need is just a modern web browser!

### Sharing BIM Made Easy

Sharing a BIM model with your teams has never been so easy. Generating a password-protected link is safe and quick. You can also view a bimU.io hosted model from other applications, such as a project site or a collaboration workspace, by inserting an embed code. bimU.io Viewer is fully-managed. No additional server or account management work is required. You can log in to bimU.io with your company or organisational account. And most importantly, you have full control over your BIM models.

### Seamless Integration with Authoring Software

Currently, supported BIM authoring tools and file format include Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Navisworks, Trimble Tekla Structures, and IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). bimU.io is backed by the so-called **Pluginless** technology that is made to exchange data with BIM software without leaving web browser. You only have to work with one single user interface! Isn't this briliiant? A 3D model view can be uploaded directly from any of supported BIM software via browser. By opening a saved viewpoint attached to a markup, bimU.io can navigate you to the same location in any of supported BIM software, too.
