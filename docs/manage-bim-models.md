# Manage BIM Models
After logging in successfully, you should see the main user interface which is made up of three sections and looks something like the following screenshot.

- **Menu bar** is on the top right where you can upload models, check out notifications and upload progress, edit user profile, check launcher and web app versions, report problems, view documentation, etc.
- **Onboarding Information** provides some basic guidance on how to use bimU.io.
- **List of Models** is a table of all uploaded models. Your models should be managed from here. See more details below.

### Sample Models

Four sample models are provided for a new user to play around: 

- **Sample_Building.rvt:** A 6-floor residential building modelled in Autodesk Revit.
- **Sample_Federated.nwd:** A number of Mechanical, Eletrical, and Plumbing (MEP) models combined in Autodesk Navisworks.
- **Sample_Steel:** A steel frame structure modelled in Trimble Tekla Structures.
- **Sample_OBD.ifc:** An architectural model of a simple building modelled in Bentley OpeningBuildings Designer (formerly AECOsim Building Designer).

### Model Properties

- **Name:** Model filename or document name.
- **Label:** Indicating whether a model is labelled.
- **Source:** Indicating what BIM software or format a model was uploaded from.
- **Size:** Model file size after compression. IFC files won't be compressed.
- **Updated:** Last updated timestamp. Models are sorted by this property.
- **Share:** Indicating whether a model is shared.

### Label a Model

Label is a simple way to categorise your models. There are five different color labels to choose from. Click on the same color label to remove it.

### View a Model

Open model viewer by clicking the magnifier button or simply clicking on a model name.

### Share a Model

A **Share Settings** dialog will pop up after switching on the toggle button. You can also open it from the three-dot button.

Once sharing is enabled, a model is accessible by anyone who has the link shown in the dialog. Login is not required to view a shared model. It is not possible to make any change to it via the link. But we strongly suggest set a password to protect your model and only share it privately. To disable sharing, simply switch off the toggle button.

### Embed a Model

You can embed a model and view it within other web applications, such as Microsoft Teams or Microsoft SharePoint. More details can be found [here](embed-in-other-applications.md).

### Rename a Model

To rename a model, click the three-dot button and then click the **Rename** option from the context menu.

### Delete a Model

To delete a model, click the three-dot button and then click the **Delete** option from the context menu. Note that this operation cannot be undone.
