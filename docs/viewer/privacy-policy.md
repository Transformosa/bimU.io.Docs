### Data Retention

Transformosa seeks to ensure that it retains only data necessary to effectively conduct its program activities and work in fulfilment of its mission. The need to retain data varies widely with the type of data and the purpose for which it was collected. Transformosa strives to ensure that data is only retained for the period necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected and is fully deleted when no longer required. This policy sets forth Transformosa’s guidelines on data retention and is to be consistently applied throughout the organisation.

#### Scope

This policy covers all data collected by Transformosa and stored on Transformosa owned or leased systems and media, regardless of location. It applies to both data
collected and held electronically (including photographs, video and audio recordings) and data that is collected and held as hard copy or paper files. The need to retain certain information may be mandated by federal or local law, federal regulations and legitimate business purposes, as well as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

#### Reasons for Data Retention

Transformosa retains only that data that is necessary to effectively conduct its program activities, fulfill its mission and comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Reasons for data retention include:

- Providing an ongoing service to the data subject (e.g. sending a newsletter, publication or ongoing program updates to an individual)
- Compliance with applicable labour, tax and immigration laws.
- Other regulatory requirements.
- Security incident or other investigation.
- Intellectual property preservation.
- Litigation.

#### Data Duplication
Transformosa seeks to avoid duplication in data storage whenever possible, though there may be instances in which for programmatic or other business reasons it is necessary for data to be held in more than one place. This policy applies to all data in Transformosa’s possession, including duplicate copies of data.

#### Retention Requirements
Transformosa has set the following guidelines for retaining all personal data.

- Website visitor data will be retained as long as necessary to provide the service requested/initiated through the Transformosa-ownd websites.
- Contributor data will be retained for the year in which the individual has contributed and then for five years after the date of the last contribution. Financial information will not be retained longer than is necessary to process a single transaction.
- Event participant data will be retained for the period of the event, including any follow up activities, such as the distribution of reports, plus a period of two years;
- Personal data of subgrantees, subcontractors and vendors will be kept for the duration of the contract or agreement.
- Consultant (both paid and pro bono) data will be held for the duration of the consulting contract plus ten years after the end of the consultancy.
- Data associated with tax payments (including payroll, corporate and VAT) will be held for ten years.

#### Data Destruction
Data destruction ensures that Transformosa manages the data it controls and processes it in an efficient and responsible manner. When the retention period for the data as outlined above expires, Transformosa will actively destroy the data covered by this policy. If an individual believes that there exists a legitimate business reason why certain data should not be destroyed at the end of a retention period, he or she should identify this data to his/her supervisor and provide information as to why the data should not be destroyed. Any exceptions to this data retention policy must be approved by Transformosa’s data protection offer in consultation with legal counsel. In rare circumstances, a litigation hold may be issued by legal counsel prohibiting the destruction of certain documents. A litigation hold remains in effect until released by legal counsel and prohibits the destruction of data subject to the hold.

#### Data Deletion Request
If you need to delete data from the services Transformosa offers for any reason, then you can send a data deletion request for its removal. You need to prove that you have the data ownership or full permission on your account. Please log a ticket on our support centre for this request.
