BIM is not exclusive to BIM managers and technicians. We've built an easy-to-use platform for everyone to review 3D design data without getting hands dirty. Simply upload your BIM model and it will be accessible via a browser instantly. Do some markups then share it securely or embed it in your collaboration software. All can be done with the Free version of bimU.io Viewer. Fully Functional Design Review Tool \u00b6 What's more than a 3D visulisation tool? bimU.io Viewer is natively built for reviewing engineering design in the Cloud. It includes everything you need to interrogate BIM data, such as versatile 3D navigation tools, a cloud-hosted BIM database, an interoperable markup view, etc. bimU.io transforms your BIM model to a lightweight BIM format that is blazingly fast and smooth over the internet and available on all your devices. What you really need is just a modern web browser! Sharing BIM Made Easy \u00b6 Sharing a BIM model with your teams has never been so easy. Generating a password-protected link is safe and quick. You can also view a bimU.io hosted model from other applications, such as a project site or a collaboration workspace, by inserting an embed code. bimU.io Viewer is fully-managed. No additional server or account management work is required. You can log in to bimU.io with your company or organisational account. And most importantly, you have full control over your BIM models. Seamless Integration with Authoring Software \u00b6 Currently, supported BIM authoring tools and file format include Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Navisworks, Trimble Tekla Structures, and IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). bimU.io is backed by the so-called Pluginless technology that is made to exchange data with BIM software without leaving web browser. You only have to work with one single user interface! Isn't this briliiant? A 3D model view can be uploaded directly from any of supported BIM software via browser. By opening a saved viewpoint attached to a markup, bimU.io can navigate you to the same location in any of supported BIM software, too. Feature List \u00b6 Cross-platform across all devices, including desktop, tablet, phone, etc. A variety of 3D navigation tools, such as orbit, rotate, pan, zoom, zoom to fit, zoom to selection, section box, section around selection, hide elements, measuring tools, fullscreen mode, etc. Create markups with free-hand drawings, comments, and a saved camera viewpoint. Query BIM data on the fly without downloading the whole database, including element properties, document properties, project information, file metadata, etc. Upload a partial or entire model with current view settings from BIM software with the \"Pluginless\" technology. Open a saved viewpoint in bimU.io 3D viewer or navigate to the same location in BIM software. Upload open standard IFC files directly via browser. Single Sign-On (SSO) support via Google OAuth and Microsoft Azure Active Directory. Share a BIM model publicly or with a password-protected link. Embed a BIM model in other software, such as Microsoft Teams, Microsoft SharePoint, or your own website. Real-time browser notification and email notification. Categorise models by colored labels. Video Podcast \u00b6 We are constantly adding short clips to the playlist below to demonstrate the functionality of bimU.io. Stay tuned on our our social media ( Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , Blog ) for the updates. User Support \u00b6 bimU.io Support Centre provides different types of help: FAQ: You can find a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and answers.

Note that sharing must be switched on to embed a bimU.io model. Types of Embedding \u00b6 IFrame: An IFrame (Inline Frame) is an HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document embedded inside another HTML document on a website. The IFrame HTML element is often used to insert content from another source, such as a video, into a webpage. Embed URL : To have better control of how overall user interface looks like, some hosting applications might prefer a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) link to an external webpage rather than an IFrame. Open the Embed Options from the three-dot menu. Both IFrame code and embed URL can be found in there. Embed in Microsoft Teams \u00b6 Microsoft Teams is cloud-based team collaboration software that is part of the Office 365 suite of applications. The core capabilities include business messaging, calling, video meetings, file sharing, etc. It also supports embedding an external website within a tab in a channel. You can add a new tab by clicking the plus button and then select Website from various apps. Copy an Embed URL from a bimU.io model and paste it into the URL field shown in the above dialog. Embed in Microsoft SharePoint \u00b6 Microsoft SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Organizations use SharePoint to create websites and manage documents. There two types of user interface: Classic and Modren. Classic SharePoint was a traditional look while Modern SharePoint is a whole new experience introduced to create responsive websites for different devices and screen sizes. Modern SharePoint exists only in SharePoint Online. You might need to ask your IT administrator to whitelist bimU.io URL if it is blocked. Modern SharePoint Page Simply add an Embed web part in a Modern SharePoint Page and insert either Embed URL or IFrame code copied from a bimU.io model. Classic SharePoint Page You can insert a Page Viewer web part in a Classic SharePoint Page. Then open the tool pane and paste an Embed URL copied from a bimU.io model in the Link text box. You might want to adjust the layout and the appearance a bit to make it look better. Embed in Your Own Website \u00b6 Most CMS (Content Management System) websites, such as WordPress, can embed an external webapge by different technologies. You might need a plugin for this, too.

You can view your model in a 3D viewer along with BIM data and saved markups. Use 3D Viewer \u00b6 bimU.io's 3D viewer is web-based, which means that it is cross-platform and can be used on any device as long as you have a WebGL-enabled browser installed. We suggest use the latest version of Google Chrome to achieve the best performance. The viewer toolbar is located at the bottom of the 3D viewer. The status labels will be shown on the bottom left when you make changes, such as enabling sectiong, selecting elements, changing element visibility, etc. Basic Viewer Controls \u00b6 You can control the camera with the following tools to view the 3D scene from different perspectives. Orbit: The orbit tool allows you to rotate the camera around your model by using left mouse drag on desktop or one finger swipe on mobile devices. The camera will orbit around the centre of current selection or the previous zoom target. Pan: The pan tool allows you to move the camera vertically or horizontally by using right mouse drag on desktop or two-finger scroll on mobile devices. Zoom: The zoom tool allows you to zoom in to focus on a specific area or zoom out to see more of your model by using mouse wheel on desktop or two-finger pinch on mobile devices. The zoom speed will decrease gradually as the camera gets closer to the zoom target. Specfic Camera Viewpoints \u00b6 You can use the following tools to set camera viewpoint to specific areas you want to see. Zoom to Fit: This tool fits the entire model into the current viewport. It is particularly useful when you get lost in the 3D scene. Zoom to Selection: This tool fits the selected elements into the current viewport to focus on them. You can use this tool if a target is too far or too close to zoom. Open Viewpoint: This tool opens the current camera viewpoint in BIM software. See more details here . You must have bimU.io Launcher installed to open a viewpoint in BIM software. Rotate View: This tool can view your model from all sides of the bounding box, including top, bottom, front, back, left, and right. Section Cut \u00b6 You can enable sectioning to slice your model to view more details inside. To disable sectioning, use the Reset Visibility tool. Section Box: This tool cuts model geometry by a rectangular box. The six edges of the section box can be adjusted using the grips. Section around Selection: This tool creates a section box around the selected elements. Then you can expand it to view the adjacent area. Model Elements \u00b6 Select Elements: Use left mouse click to select a model element. Shift + Left click to select multiple elements. Hide Elements: This tool hides the selected elements. You can use the Reset Visibility tool to unhide them. Other Viewer Capabilities \u00b6 Reset Visibility: This tool unhides all hidden elements and disables sectioning. Measuring Tool: A few different measurement tools are available, such as reporting coordinates, measuring distance, height, angle, area, etc. Toogle Fullscreen: This tool presents the entire viewport of the 3D viewer in browser's fullscreen mode. Use Orthographic Camera: This tool can switch the camera between perspective and orthographic projection. Switch to Embedded Mode: This tool enables the embedded mode which isolates the 3D viewer from the user interface. You can still view BIM data from the toolbar. It is particularly useful when the fullscreen mode is not supported, such as iOS devices. Work with Markups \u00b6 In bimU.io, a markup is more than an image with some sketches. In addition to adding lines, shapes, freehand drawings, texts, etc. to annotate a screenshot of model view, every markup can capture a camera viewpoint and include a short description. You can then navigate to this location in a model later by opening the viewpoint in the 3D viewer or other BIM software. The concept is similar to BIM Collaboration Format (BCF). bimU.io Agile, our full-fledged BIM issue tracking solution, will also support BCF in early 2020. Create a Markup \u00b6 Click the Create Markup placeholder in the Markup Tab and a dialog will pop up where you can find various drawing and annotation tools. If you want to paste an image taken from elsewhere, simply paste it from clipboard into the dialog by Ctrl + V. Add some description and Click Save when you are done. View a Markup \u00b6 All markups attached to a model are shown in the Markup Tab . Click a thumbnail to enlarge it and view its details. You can also edit description, download image, or delete it in the lightbox. Open Viewpoint in Web Viewer \u00b6 A viewpoint attached to a markup can be opened directly in the 3D viewer. It would restore previous camera location, angle, sectioning state, etc. Open Viewpoint in BIM Software \u00b6 You must have bimU.io Launcher installed to open a viewpoint in BIM software. Make sure bimU.io Launcher is running and connected to browser. Then you can open a saved viewpoint in any supported BIM software as long as a corresponding model file is also opened. More details around bimU.io Launcher can be found here . View BIM Data \u00b6 Uploaded BIM data normally consists of document information, element properties, and file metadata which can be viewed from the following three tabs. Model Tab \u00b6 Model specific data refers to document-level information, such as project details, location, coordinate system, other authoring software metadata, etc. Element Tab \u00b6 Model element data includes all properties of a selected element. It can be a Revit Parameter , a Navisworks Property , a Tekla Attribute , or an IfcPropertySingleValue. File Tab \u00b6 These are file properties specific to bimU.io, such as model source, file size, timestamp, etc. Mobile User Interface \u00b6 A simplified user interface will be enabled on a mobile device if the screen size is too small. You can still view BIM data from the toolbar though some of the tools might be disabled. The main user interface might be available if you change device orientation to landscape mode and then refresh the entire page.","title":"Navigate Using Web Viewer"},{"location":"viewer/navigate-using-web-viewer/#nagivate-using-web-model-viewer","text":"Clicking the magnifier button or on a model name brings you to a web model viewer page.

Governing Law"},{"location":"viewer/upload-a-bim-model/","text":"Upload a BIM Model \u00b6 There are two ways to upload your BIM models: Upload from BIM Software: Uploading from a BIM model view within authoring software gives you more control of how it looks like on bimU.io. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG). Please follow the instructions in the next section to install the bimU.io Launcher before uploading a BIM model from authoring software. Upload IFC files: The industry standard IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format is also supported. Most authoring software can export to an IFC file. You can then upload it to bimU.io directly. Install bimU.io Launcher \u00b6 Note that you must have bimU.io Launcher installed to upload a model from BIM software. What is bimU.io Launcher? \u00b6 bimU.io Launcher is a middleware that exchanges data between bimU.io and BIM software. It is a background process running along with BIM software without a user interface. Unlike other third-party tools that require a plugin opened manually within various BIM software for exporting data, bimU.io Launcher implements the so-called Pluginless technology which allows users to stick with a single user interface, i.e., using bimU.io via browser. Supported BIM Software \u00b6 Autodesk Revit 2014-2020 Autodesk Navisworks 2014-2020 Trimble Tekla Structures 21.0-2019 Download Installer \u00b6 Download bimU.io Launcher 2019.10.14.0 Please close all BIM software sessions prior to installation. The latest version of bimU.io Launcher is 2019.10.14.0. The installer can downloaded from the link above. Technically speaking, admin right is NOT required for the installation. Please speak to your IT staffs if you don't have permission to install it. Automatic Update \u00b6 bimU.io Launcher performs automatic update behind the scene for the installed components. However, you will need to download a new installer for a new version of BIM software. For example, bimU.io Launcher can update itself for Autodesk software 2014-2020 whenever bimU.io has a new release or a bug fixed. But a new installer will be required to support Autodesk software 2021 next year. You can check out the installed version fo bimU.io Launcher from the top menu bar. For an automatic update to take effect immediately, we suggest repeat the following steps twice : Restart your machine or log off Windows. Make sure you have a stable internet connection. Open any supported BIM software. Open any file and wait for one minute. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you have any problem installing or using bimU.io Launcher, please log a support ticket with the following two items attached if they exist: Log File: Open Windows File Explorer and paste %localappdata%\\temp\\bimU.io.log in the address bar. The log file is stored as launcher.log in the folder. Error Code: An error code, such as No BIM software is currently opened. Error code: 1002 , would be shown in browser when something goes wrong on bimU.io. Upload from BIM Software \u00b6 Uploading from various BIM software has similar steps on bimU.io: Open a 3D model view in any supported BIM software. Make sure visisblity and appearance of model elements are as desired. Click the plus button in the top menu bar and select Upload from BIM Software . Select a Model Source (i.e., BIM software) where you want to upload from. Review screenshot and click the Refresh icon button if you want to start over. Change Model Name if you want a different one from current filename. Click the Upload button to proceed. Every BIM software handles 3D computer graphics differently. The general rules for bimU.io export are: Only visible model elements in the current 3D view are exported. Model unit is converted to meter. Materials are exported without textures. See below for more details around how bimU.io exports a model from every BIM software. Export from Autodesk Revit \u00b6 2D View , Family Document and Analytical Model are NOT supported for export at the moment. You must have a 3D View opened to start the upload process. Visible Linked Models in the current 3D View are exported, too. Visisblity and appearance of Elements can be determined based on a number of factors, such as Section Box , Visibility/Graphic Override , Temporary Hide/Isolate , etc. Both Type Parameters and Instance Parameters are exported. Some file metadata, such as Document properties, Project Information , Project Position , Site Location , etc. are exported, too. Model coordinates are converted to Shared Coordinates . Export from Autodesk Navisworks \u00b6 Appearance of Model Items can be determined by Color and Transparency Override . However, Sectioning is NOT currently supported. If you don't want to export some of the Model Items , you'll have to select and hide them manually. Most of the Properties shown in the Properties Window are exported, including Document -level properties. Export from Trimble Tekla Structures \u00b6 Visible Model Objects in the active Work Area are exported. Color settings are defined by Tekla and cannot be changed. The exported Model Objects include Part , Assembly , Pour Object , Base Component . The exported properties include Model Information , Project Information , User-Defined Attributes , and the properties defined in the Global Attributes . Export from Other BIM Software \u00b6 bimU.io Launcher doesn't integrate with other BIM software at the moment. As a workaround, you can export to an IFC file from most BIM authoring software, such as Graphisoft ArchiCAD, Bentley OpeningBuildings Designer (formerly AECOsim Building Designer), etc. Monitor Progress \u00b6 DO NOT close browser window before the upload is finished. You can check out the progress from the top menu bar while a model is being exported and uploaded. You might cancel it if necessary. Upload an IFC File \u00b6 Both IFC 2x3 and IFC 4 formats are supported. Uploading an IFC file is quite straightforward. Simply click the plus button in the top menu bar and select Upload IFC File . The upload process will start as soon as you select or drag and drop an IFC file in the dialog. Upload Other 3D File Formats \u00b6 We aim to support more and more authoring software and 3D file formats in the future. The below items have been prioritised for developement. Note that the delivery timelines may change. Stay tuned on our our social media ( Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , Blog ) for the updates. McNeel Rhinoceros 3D (.3dm): May 2020 Trimble SketchUp (.skp): June 2020 Notifications \u00b6 bimU.io will process your model immediately after upload. Depending on file size, it can often be done in minutes. When a model is ready to view, you will receive an email notification and also a browser notification if you have bimU.io opened. Current Limitations \u00b6 To optimise computing and storage resources, bimU.io limits the size of a model that you can upload to bimU.io Viewer Free . Currently, the following soft limits apply per model file and will be increased for paid users in the near future. These should be sufficient for most use cases. Compressed upload file size: 250 MB Number of visible model elements: 200,000 Uncompressed model geometry size: 2,500 MB IFC upload file size: 150 MB","title":"Upload a BIM model"},{"location":"viewer/upload-a-bim-model/#upload-a-bim-model","text":"There are two ways to upload your BIM models: Upload from BIM Software: Uploading from a BIM model view within authoring software gives you more control of how it looks like on bimU.io.
